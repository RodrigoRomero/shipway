A single operator in charge of the whole logistics chain!<br /><br />

We pick up the cargo at the point of origin and deliver it at the final destination by combining different means of transport. Our client pay in one single invoice all the logistics services involved without having to hire and deal with different operators to complete their supply chain.<br /><br />

Easier, faster and effective!

Shipway has defined the following process to manage the Projects:<br /><br />

Initiating > Planning > Executing > Monitoring and Controlling > Closing.<br /><br />

There are certain variables or incidents that are not known at the beginning of a project. Therefore, the success of the GLPM will be based on the expertise, knowledge and imagination of the relevant working team to address critical situations and find appropriate solutions to unexpected events.<br /><br />

This means that we plan even the unplanned!<br /><br />

                                            <p>The insurance policies for goods in transit require careful treatment and close control to avoid leaving goods uncovered and, in the unfortunate event of a loss, to salvage them as soon as practicable.<br /><br />

Shipway’s Insurance division works with many insurers assessing the risks of each client’s goods and suggesting the best option, case by case.<br /><br />

In the event of loss, we work closely with our clients until they receive their indemnification and resume their ordinary business.<br /><br />
